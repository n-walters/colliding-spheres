# colliding-spheres

A simple one-page experiment into some basic physics simulation using spheres that collide with each other.

2D elastic collisions are modelled upon contact, and the system can be dynamically interfered with using the mouse to apply the effect of an attractive or repulsive forces.

A few other minor things are thrown in, largely just visual customisations.
